    <h2 class="sub-title">Education and Training</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Becoming a front-end web developer requires, at minimum, a high school diploma.
      The most important thing for a front-end web developer is that they understand and can demonstrate
      the fundamentals of front-end development, programming languages, and front-end frameworks 
      (<a class="text-links" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-frontend-developer/" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>). 
      To that end, pursuing a bachelor's degree, completing a certification program, or completing a coding boot camp are all
      excellent ways to gain the required understanding through formal training and education.
      The best informal education and training is repetition to get practice designing website front ends
