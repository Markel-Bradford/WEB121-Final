# Final project for WEBD 121 at American Military Univarsity
This was my final project for my web development fundamentals class. The object was to build an informational website about
my desired job after graduation using what we learned in the course. The requirements were to utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to build an aesthetically pleasing and functional webstie. 

Please feel free to take a look at my code. Thanks!
